Cipher Memories is a platform for storing and sharing encrypted personal memories. The platform allows users to create both private encrypted memories (personal and donations) and public shared memories, providing a secure space for preserving digital content.

I starteded this project to learn Go and web development. I begin as something exploratory and playful, but I'm trying to make it more useful and functional.

I thought about this project as a Human Memory Repository, where we can store our memories and share them with humanity for years to come.
