                <h3>Psychological Perspective:</h3>

                <p>Memory is the faculty by which the brain encodes, stores, and retrieves information 
                    about past experiences. It's divided into different types like short-term memory, 
                    long-term memory, sensory memory, etc. Memory shapes our identity, influences our 
                    behavior, and guides our decisions.</p>

                <p>Explicit Memory: Memory that can be consciously recalled and described.*</p>

                <p>Implicit Memory: Memory that is not consciously recalled or inferred from behaviors, 
                    performances and diverse contexts and situations.</p>

                <h3>Biological Perspective:</h3>

                <p></p>At a cellular level, memory involves changes in neural connections and the 
                strength of synapses in the brain. This process, known as synaptic plasticity, 
                includes phenomena like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).</p>

                <p>LTP: Long-term potentiation, a process that strengthens synapses over time.</p>

                <p>LTD: Long-term depression, a process that weakens synapses over time.</p>

                <h3>Cultural and Social Perspective:</h3>

                <p>Memory can also refer to collective or cultural memories, where groups of people share 
                    and pass down historical events, traditions, or narratives which define their 
                    identity or cultural heritage.</p>

                <p>In computing, memory refers to the components of a computer that store data for 
                    use while the computer is running.</p>

                <p>Volatile Memory: Memory that loses data when power is lost.</p>

                <h3>Verbal attacks directed to individuals stemming from memories can be considered violence?</h3>

            </div>

            <div class="context">
                <p>Verbal attacks or harassment that are triggered by memories can indeed be considered a form 
                    of psychological or emotional violence. When memories provoke negative emotions or reactions, 
                    leading to aggressive or harmful communication, this can have corelated or causal 
                    psychological and physical effects on the recipient.</p>

                <p>Many jurisdictions recognize verbal abuse or harassment as a form of violence, 
                    especially when it leads to emotional harm. The intent behind the words, 
                    the context in which they are said, and the impact on the individual 
                    are important factors.</p>

        <p><strong>Cipher Memories</strong> focuses on human memory to be stored in a repository, exploring how personal memories shape individual and collective narratives, influence behavior, and can be recorded, shared, or preserved.</p>

        <p>We can use Cipher Memories as a tool to explore and analyze memories, and to create new memories that can be shared with all humans.</p>

        <p>Digital story telling is a way to share memories with others, and to create new memories that can be shared with all humans. But you can share your memories with no technical burden, and no need to be a professional story teller.</p>
