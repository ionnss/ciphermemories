# What is a Memory?


### Psychological Perspective:

Memory is the faculty by which the brain encodes, stores, and retrieves information about past experiences. It's divided into different types like short-term memory, long-term memory, sensory memory, etc. Memory shapes our identity, influences our behavior, and guides our decisions.

- **INCLUDE:**
    - Explicit Memory: Memory that can be consciously recalled and described.*

    - Implicit Memory: Memory that is not consciously recalled but can be observed through behavior or performance.


### Biological Perspective:

At a cellular level, memory involves changes in neural connections and the strength of synapses in the brain. This process, known as synaptic plasticity, includes phenomena like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).

- **INCLUDE:**
    - LTP: Long-term potentiation, a process that strengthens synapses over time.

    - LTD: Long-term depression, a process that weakens synapses over time.

### Cultural and Social Perspective: 

Memory can also refer to collective or cultural memories, where groups of people share and pass down historical events, traditions, or narratives which define their identity or cultural heritage.

- **INCLUDE:**
    - Examples:



### Computational Perspective: 

In computing, memory refers to the components of a computer that store data for use while the computer is running.

- **INCLUDE:**
    - Volatile Memory: Memory that loses data when power is lost.

    - Non-Volatile Memory: Memory that retains data even when power is lost.

**Cipher Memories** focuses on human memory to be stored in a repository, exploring how personal memories shape individual and collective narratives, influence behavior, and can be recorded, shared, or preserved.

We can use Cipher Memories as a tool to explore and analyze memories, and to create new memories that can be shared with all humans.

Digital story telling is a way to share memories with others, and to create new memories that can be shared with all humans. But you can share your memories with no technical burden, and no need to be a professional story teller.

## Questions:

> **Verbal attacks directed to individuals stemming from memories can be considered violence?**

### Context: 

Verbal attacks or harassment that are triggered by memories can indeed be considered a form of psychological or emotional violence. When memories provoke negative emotions or reactions, leading to aggressive or harmful communication, this can have corelated or causal psychological and physical effects on the recipient.

- **INCLUDE:**
    - How such attacks can perpetuate cycles of violence or trauma?
    - How such attacks can be used to manipulate or control individuals? (?)
    - How such attacks can be used to justify or rationalize violence? (?)

### Legal and Ethical Considerations: 

Many jurisdictions recognize verbal abuse or harassment as a form of violence, especially when it leads to emotional harm. The intent behind the words, the context in which they are said, and the impact on the individual are important factors. 

- **INCLUDE:**
    - What specific laws or legal cases we can reference where verbal abuse was recognized as violence, if available?


### Psychological and Physical Impact: 

Verbal attacks can lead to psychological trauma, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

- **INCLUDE:**
    - Psychological Impact: 
    - Physical Impact:

### Conclusion:

Yes, verbal attacks originating from memories can be considered violence, particularly in the realm of psychological violence, if they cause harm or distress. However, the intent behind the words, the context in which they are said, and the impact on the individual are important factors to consider when determining if the verbal attack is considered violence to an specific targeted individual.

- **INCLUDE:**
    - Whats the importante of context in legal or ethical judgments regarding such verbal attacks?


> **How to determine if a Memory is Amoral and Unethical?**

### Amoral:

Memory, in itself, does not carry moral weight, if considered as an act of recounting. If a memory is shared without any intent to judge or influence morally other than the recounting itself, it could be seen as amoral - neither good nor bad in the context of the recounting and in a cultural context, just factual.

- **INCLUDE:**
    - The morality of memory recounting or a recounted memory can depend on cultural or historical context?



### Unethical:

For a memory to be considered unethical in its recounting, it might involve:

- Privacy Invasion: Sharing private details without consent.
- Malicious Intent: Using the memory to manipulate, harm, or defame someone.
- Inaccuracy: Altering or omitting facts to serve a narrative, which could mislead or harm others.

- **INCLUDE:**
    - How can intent can sometimes be hard to prove or interpret?

### Foundation: 

#### Contextual Analysis:

Examine the context in which the memory is shared. Is there an intent to harm or benefit? 

- **INCLUDE:**
    - How does context completly changes the ethical interpretation of sharing a memory?

#### Narrative Analysis:

Look at how the memory is framed or narrated. Is it done objectively, or does it serve an agenda?

- **INCLUDE:**
    - Can language choice or framing subtly shift the ethical interpretation of sharing a memory?

#### Ethical Frameworks: 

Apply ethical theories like consequentialism (effects of sharing), deontology (duties concerning privacy and truth), or virtue ethics (the character of the one sharing the memory).

- **INCLUDE:**
    - Consequentialism: The effects of sharing a memory.
    - Deontology: Duties concerning privacy and truth.
    - Virtue Ethics: The character of the one sharing the memory.

#### Conclusion:

To argue that recounting a memory is amoral and unethical, you would need to show that the act of sharing does not inherently carry moral implications (amoral) but can be enacted in ways that breach ethical standards (unethical). The burden of proof would lie in demonstrating the intent, impact, and ethical implications of how the memory is shared.

LETS DISCUSS TOGETHER!

If a memory is harmful to you, will it be harmful to others? Will it be harmful to Cipher's Memories system?

By sharing how harmful a memory is for you, you can open up new perspectives on existence for other humans.
